You run the following code:

```
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan','margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'
```

and get the following error message:
```
TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

What's the problem and how can it be fixed?

The problem is `names['margaret']`. We're trying to replace the name margaret with jody, but we can't reference it how we're trying to. When using brackets next to an array name like this, the program is looking for an index of margaret, which is incorrect syntax. To fix it, you can input margaret's actual index of 3 to have it replaced.
