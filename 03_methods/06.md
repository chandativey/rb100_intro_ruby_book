>  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
>  from (irb):4
>  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

You have provided only 1 argument, which is the incorrect number of arguments for a method that requires 2 arguments. The name of the method is `calculate_product` and the error is on line 4 of irb.
